## Week 5

Reflections : 

- Generics , Type variables ( covariance , contravariance ) are very similar to other OO paradigm
- Singleton Types as far as I can say this is some kind of "new approach" , not very likely to be a new "type"
- Structural is interesting ( and similar to Typescript ) where you can define a structure for anything instead of explicity create another Class
- As Dependency Injection,  the convention of injecting service is plain simple 

The difficult parts : 
- Monoids
- Functors

However , I have asked Huy for some assistance regarding this , and we are looking forward to see if we can make use of this for our project work
