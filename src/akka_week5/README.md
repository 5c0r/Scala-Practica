## Integration
Integration can be done with Camel or akka-http . However , akka-http is more preferred since Camel is getting deprecated

## Reflection

We were able to kickstart the project with akka-http and everything went as smooth as possible. However we are thinking what are your requirements regarding usage of Akka, or  distributed systems for the project ?
